# Astrophotography Webpage 

Webpage to showcase astrophotography taken by me.
Created using a Hugo template created by [CaiJimmy](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack-starter)

## Update theme manually

Run:

```bash
hugo mod get -u github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack/v3
hugo mod tidy
```

> This starter template has been configured with `v3` version of theme. Due to the limitation of Go module, once the `v4` or up version of theme is released, you need to update the theme manually. (Modifying `config/module.toml` file)
